CZ3007 Compiler Techniques Lab Assignments

### Lab 1: Implement a Lexical Analyzer
The analyzer will be used to convert a simple programming language called PL/3007 to Java bytecode. Main work was done under `Lab1/src/frontend/lexer.flex`, in which the analyzer will be generated via JFlex. The analyzer is also tested against the test cases written in `Lab1/src/test/LexerTests.java`.
